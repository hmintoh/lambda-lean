              <p>
                Even the best sound systems can be marred by poor acoustics in a
                given space and therefore we have dedicated some of our time and
                energy to help our clients achieve optimal solutions for the
                acoustics in their given space.
              </p>
              <p>
                We have the ability to advise on acoustic and spatial design
                while working with architects on new projects as well as
                improving the acoustics of an existing space.
