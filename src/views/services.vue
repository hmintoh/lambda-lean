              Even the best sound systems can be marred by poor acoustics in a
              given space. We have dedicated some of our time and energy to help
              our clients achieve optimal solutions for the acoustics in their
              given space.

            <p>
              We have the ability to advise on acoustic and spatial design while
              working with architects on new projects as well as improving the
              acoustics of an existing space.
